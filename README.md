A portfolio of scripts. 

To download the complete game build, go to https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQJmnuTufRB4M1qR5EOCZF5axVUhNY27/view?usp=sharing .

Sadly, the computer I built this game on died so I couldn't go back and find the original files, however, 
I had the full build for mac on a flash drive so that is what the link will download. 
I can't get the game for windows because the computer is dead, so I think the game will only work on mac.

Controls:
1: Pull out crossbow.
2: Pull out sword (a little buggy but it does the trick).
Q: Pickup and drop items.
WASD: Move
Mouse 1: Shoot
Mouse 2: Scope
P: Pause Game
R: Restart
