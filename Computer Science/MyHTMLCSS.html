                    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
                    <p>Leonard Hirshberg is a man born on August 10th, 1880. He was always a fan of science and learning as a kid and that eventually led to the start of his career. Once he finished high school, he applied to NYU and got in. He completed
                        his undergraduate degree at NYU and then decided he wanted to learn more and applied to get a bachelors degree from the University of Columbia in inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. After 4 years, Hirshberg decided he loved the
                        school so much he wanted to continue going there. Keene studied and became a proffessor of inorganic chemistry and organometallic chemistry at Columbia.</p>

<h2>Hirshberg's Experiment</h2>
                    <p>Leonard worked on an experiment related to the dilution and concentration of solutions. Hirshbergsâ€™s experiment was to find out if you diluted a solution with another element, if it would ever be possible to remove that element completely
                        from the solution with no traces left behind. This experiment was to try to convert undrinkable ocean water into consumable fresh water to help solve the water crisis the world would eventually come to. He used different amount
                        of sodium chloride in water and was working on creating a way to separate them.</p>
